About
-------

hiremiles.com is my personal resume website. With experience, education, beliefs, and stories listings, it serves as an all-encompassing landing page for anyone interested in working with me and looking to understand who I am.


Technical Details
------------------

hiremiles.com is hosted on Heroku. This is the first time I've used Heroku, so it's kind of an experiment.

The site is written in Node, using Express and Jade. I use TextMate (mainly, also Kod and Coda) and GitHub for Mac.


Issues Left
---------------
- Correct navigation bar
- Fonts?
- Correct IDs vs classes

Future Improvements
---------------------
- Organizing text better so it's more readable
- Cooler transitions
- Normalize css (combine rules when able to)
