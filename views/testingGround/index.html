		<p>Technology is cool, but at the end of the day, every product I contribute to is for a person. People, and adding value to their lives, is what motivates me. I love working on a close-knit, small, creative team where the collaboration level is through the roof. I also love helping my teammates grow. One of my favorite work experiences was as Resident Director at Scott Campus when I was able to help one of my teammates take the time to teach his colleagues, even though he didn't want to at first.</p>

		<a name="book" class="iconic book"></a>
		
		<p>I grew up as an Army brat. My dad served for 20 years, and in those 20 years, we moved 8 times. Moving was always tough, but I like to think I'm much better off for it. I got the opportunity to make friends all over the country, experience all sorts of different cultures and ways of living, and best of all, get the confidence and tough skin it takes to make it in a new place. It was hard leaving one of our homes, but I luckily am the oldest of three boys, so we always had each other to hang out with.</p>

    	<p>Constantly having to adjust to new teams and communities also made me into somewhat of a negotiator. I enjoy hearing discussions from people with different opinions, finding common ground, and then moving forward. I continue to use those skills today.</p>
    
        <p>The place we lived the longest (although not consecutively) was Washington D.C. Our extended family always used our house as a hotel to see the sights, which was great, and I always got brought along. I've seen the White House and all of the memorials so many times that I know them better than anyone should. I'm not complaining - this much exposure ave me a true appreciation for history and the perspective it gives. I loved reading about all of the historical figures, seeing their memorials, and in some cases, standing in the very same spots they stood. History for me is still a source of enjoyment, as it brings me comfort to hear other people's journeys. It also influences my belief that nothing should ever have to be solved twice. Having the knowledge of history gives me motivation to never repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
        
        <p>Living in a big city also exposed me to a lot of different cultural experiences. I went to a high school that specializes in fine and performing arts, where plays, concerts, historical events, literature, and artwork were a constant. I was in the creative writing program, and writing continues to be one of my biggest passions to date. The freedom of expression through art was very influential and I still love visiting museums and seeing shows.</p>
        
        <p>After 20 years of active duty army service, my dad retired and we moved to Omaha, NE. I'd never been to nebraska and wasn't particularly thrilled with moving away from my cultural center. I kept an open mind though, and I'm glad I did. Omaha has a vibrant community of genuine people, along with the space and landscape to allow for relaxation. Gone were the days of walking about the National Mall, but in were the days free of traffic.</p>
        
        <p>I finished high school and went to college in Omaha. School had always been easy for me - I graduated with two degrees and a minor in four years - taking summer school every summer, even when I wasn't living in Omaha - but the hard part was figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I wanted to do something with computers and technology, but wasn't sure, so i got one degree in Information Assurance, to focus on the security side of computing, and the other degree in Computer Science, to focus on the development side of computing.</p>
        
        <p>To figure out if I wanted to do something more security oriented or something more development oriented, I worked a series of security jobs to see if I liked it. They were interesting and fun, but currently the security industry works by telling people how not to do things instead of teaching the right way to develop. I want to bring all positive value to the world, so I chose to lean more on my development degree. I knew this when I went to Sandia National Labs the summer before my senior year, so I really took an interest in one of my three projects, which was to develop custom software. It was a great experience that taught me a lot about developing an existing open source project. Seeing my contributions helping to give people a new capability was exciting and rewarding. I knew then I wanted to work on developing software.</p>
        
        <p>The next thing I had to figure out was what size and type of company it is that I want to work for. Luckily in college, I also felt it was important for me to have job experience where I could work on my teamwork and interpersonal skills. So I became a resident assistant at Scott Campus on UNO. I loved the small team atmosphere so much that I chose to apply for the resident director job to lead the group my senior year. I got hired for the job and really took to it. I was tasked with leading and developing 14 resident assistants. Our team was in charge of planning and running community events, enforcing company policies, and responding to any and all situations around the clock. Through all of the chaos, I learned a lot about what it means to be on a team and how to lead. Those 14 people became my family (I still talk with them regularly and consider them my family) and we provided each other with the support and encouragement to perform far better as a group than any one of us could have done on our own. Many of my proudest moments are from that year. I definitely want to work on a small, creative, and free-thinking team that skips corporate red-tape to focus on adding value to customers.</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, I didn't really discover this until after much reflection on my senior year and my experience at my post-graduation job at Lockheed Martin. The people are all very nice, but large corporate and government work just isn't my cup of tea.</p>
        
        <p>My ultimate goal is to one day have a similar experience in building software as my time as a resident director. I love helping a family of people grow and work together to be something bigger and better than any one of tis pieces. It brings a smile to my face to help someone develop as a person, work better with a team, and deliver an awesome product that adds value to an overjoyed customer.</p>

		<p>I have experience in C, C++, Java, HTML5, jQuery, CSS, networking, and security. I'm also steadily learning iOS and mobile frameworks like Sencha Touch and jQuery Mobile. One of my first products was a mobile app for Android using jQTouch. I also have several projects that are still "in progress", including a Hacker News reader with Sencha Touch, and an iOS app for caregivers looking to learn more activities they can adapt to their clients. I actively participate on github at github.com/milesmatthias. You can see the full source code for a few of my side projects in progress there.</p>

<p>I also actively participate in energizing weekend teams at Startup Weekends. My first startup weekend project was Fundle.co at Startup Weekend Des Moines. We built a group payment system prototype in one weekend. I contributed to the group management and front-end development of the project. My second Startup Weekend project was Slouch Couch Video Game Studio at Startup Weekend Omaha. We made an HTML5 game about Startup Weekend that can still be played on our website at SlouchCou.ch.</p>

<p>I've also developed custom plugins for the open source project Wireshark at Sandia National Labs. I had to learn how a large established project works, and then figure out to write plugins that the operations security team at Sandia needed. The other person working with me on this project was early on in his programming education, so I did a lot of the coding for the project. We had a leader who had a full plate of work on his own, so he only had time to check in with us once a week or so. We were given all the resources we needed, and enjoyed the freedom of choosing some of the direction of the project. My choice was to write a plugin making tutorial for the Sandia operations security team members so that should they need to customize their plugins or write new ones, they would have the tools and education to do so.</p>
